## Step 1 - Setup the .env file

  

  

In the root of the application folder, rename the **`.env.example`** file to: **`.env`**.

  

Replace the variables values for the postgres database with *your own values* or leave them as is:

  

  

    DB_NAME=bot
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=postgres
    DB_HOST=localhost

  

## Step 2 - Install dependencies
from the root of the application, open the terminal and run the command:  `npm install`

  

## Step 3 - Run docker-compose

  

  

in the terminal, run the following command to setup the postgres docker image:

  

  

    docker-compose --env-file .env up

  

  

## Step 4 - run the bot

  

  

check if the database is already up and running, then in the terminal run:

  

  

    npm start

  

  

## Optional params

  

  

The application allows you to configure these optional params:

  

  

-  **pair**  *- the pair to watch f.i: BTC/EUR*

  

-  **percentage**  *- the percentage difference between prices to rise a Signal, f.i: 0.002*

  

-  **interval** - the quote interval expressed in seconds, f.i: 3

  

  

you can specify the value for the params directly in the command line as following:

  

  

    npm start pair=BTC-EUR percentage=0.002 interval=3
